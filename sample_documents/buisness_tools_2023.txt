The top business intelligence solutions make finding insights into data and effectively communicating them to stakeholders easier. It has never been more crucial for businesses to sift through massive amounts of data in search of meaningful insights, as data can now be collected on everything from sales and marketing to workflows and efficiency to hiring and HR to overall performance and profitability. However, most of this information is siloed and can only be put together with the help of specialized business intelligence (BI) tools.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are just one way this data can improve business operations based on accurate predictions. While many programs provide built-in analytics features, the results can be exported into a business intelligence system.

The greatest business intelligence tools will also be based on interactive representations that may be presented to key stakeholders, simplifying the presentation of otherwise complex data.
